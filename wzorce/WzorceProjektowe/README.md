## Observer Pattern

  - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are
  notified and updated automatically.

  - Subjects, or as we also know them, Observables, update Observers using a common interface.

  - Observers are loosely coupled in that the Observable knows nothing about them, other than that they implement the
    Observer Interface.
